# Instructions  

DO NOT COPY AND PASTE! If you do, you may find it taking longer than it otherwise would take! If you want to speed things along, try [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/).

Pay carefull attention to opening and closing tags. Bootstrap requires a lot of tags!

## Introduction

We will work on a multi-page website with directories. 

Having so many files and directories can be confusing. So, lets us Breadcrumbs to make them easy to navigate.

Some of it is done for you. 

You will be required to finish the following pages.

* /index.html
* /candy/index.html
* /candy/lollipops/index.html
* /candy/lollipops/charms.html
* /candy/lollipops/tootsieroll.html

If you complete this, you may do `chocolate` as a bonus.

DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!

You must use a [breadcrumb](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/breadcrumb/) element at the top of each page.

On the "leaf" pages: `charms.html`, `tootsieroll.html`, `kiss.html`, and `twix.html`, use a card with an image.


## Detailed instructions

Note: Finishing the `chocolate` directory is optional, but encouraged! I suggest you finish lollipops first, and then move to `chocolate` for review.

1. Run the Replit.
2. Click on Candy, then click on Lollipops, then click on Charms.
3. Notice which pages have the [Breadcrumbs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/breadcrumb/) working.
4. Your first job will be put in breadcrumbs on the pages without them.
5. Next, add a [card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) to `charms.html` and `tootsieroll.html`

### Bonus

* Add pictures to your cards
* Repeat the whole process for `/candy/chocolate`
* Practice using [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/)
* Add another component to the `/index.index` page.
* Add Rows or Cols with more content.
* Check your changes into Git after each page you finish!
